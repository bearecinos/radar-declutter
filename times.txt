Standard:
	89 from bar, 89.7 start, 66.2 from segment

New with slow viewshed: 
	380 from bar, 380.1 start, 378.1 segment

with fast viewshed:
	11 from bar, 11.5 start, 9.6 segment

NOTE: POSSIBLY NEED TO REVERSE y IN SOME PLACES??
useful: ar[:] = 0 fills whole array
Can pass through walls? [35][40], 142 after [inRange]
Get 1, should be -1
Should be fixed now
